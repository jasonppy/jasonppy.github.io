This is an introduction to reinforcement learning, including core concepts, the general goal, the general framework, introduction and comparison of different types of approaches. This section contains nighty percent of the materials that are going to be covered by this course.

## 1 Notations and Terminologies
We have introduced some of the notations in [lecture 2](https://jasonppy.github.io/deeprl/deeprl-2-imitation/). Here we give a more comprehansive introduction of the core concepts in reinforcement learningã€‚

Reinforcement learning centers around the **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: $$\mathcal{M} = \{ \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, r \}$$ with the four terms defined as:

$$\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\mathcal{S} \text{ is state space, state } s \in \mathcal{S} \text{ can be discrete or continuous} \\
&&\mathcal{A} \text{ is action space, action } a \in \mathcal{A} \text{ can be discrete or continuous} \\
&&\mathcal{T} \text{ is the transition operator } \\
&&r: \mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R} \text{ is the reward function, specify how good the state and action is}
\end{eqnarray*}$$

More on the transition operator $$\mathcal{T}$$, denote

$$\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\mu_{j} := p(s = j), t \text{ can be } \\
&&\xi_{k} := p(a = k) \\
&&\mathcal{T}_{i,j,k} := p(s' = i\mid s=j, a=k)\\
&&\text{we have } \mu_{i} = \sum_{j,k}\mathcal{T}_{i,j,k}\mu_{j}\xi_{k} \\
\end{eqnarray*}$$

The transition operator explains why the process is call Markov Decision Processes, this is because the state sequence has first order markov property, i.e. suppose $$s'$$ is the subsequent state of $$s$$, than $$s'$$ is independent of any previous state given $$s$$. A grapical model of MDPs is

For simplicity, we illustrate the transition operator using discrete state and action space. I didn't find any illustration for the continuous case. Actually trainsition operator is rarely used in this course, most of the time we just use the transition probability $$p(s'\mid s,a)$$ (more often writen as $$p(s_{t+1}\mid s_t, a_t)$$). To avoid confusion, the community also refer to the transition probability as *model*, *dynamics*, or *transition dynamics*.

Another process that is also common in reinforcement learning is called **Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)**: $$\mathcal{M} = \{ \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{O}, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{E}, r \}$$

$$\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\mathcal{S} \text{ is state space, state } s \in \mathcal{S} \text{ can be discrete or continuous} \\
&&\mathcal{A} \text{ is action space, action } a \in \mathcal{A} \text{ can be discrete or continuous} \\
&&\mathcal{O} \text{ is observation space, observation } o \in \mathcal{O} \text{ can be discrete or continuous} \\
&&\mathcal{E} \text{ the set for emission probability }p(o\mid s) \\
&&\mathcal{T} \text{ is the transition operator } \\
&&r: \mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R} \text{ is the reward function, specify how good the state and action is}
\end{eqnarray*}$$

Comapre to MDPs, POMDPs have two more terms, observation space $$\mathcal{O}$$ and emission probability set $$\mathcal{E}$$. State sequence still satisfies first order Markov property, but it's not observable. We can only observe observation $$o$$ which doesn't satisfy markov property. The model/dynamics is still on states and actions rather than on observations and actions, i.e. $$p(s'\mid s,a) \text{ rather than } p(o'\mid o,a)$$ and we have one addition probability distribution to worry about which is the emission probability $$p(o\mid s)$$. The graphical model for POMDPs is shown below:

In the previous section on [imitation learning](https://jasonppy.github.io/deeprl/deeprl-2-imitation/), we define policy as $$\pi_{\theta}(a_t\mid o_t)$$. This is actually a more general case compare to $$\pi_{\theta}(a_t\mid s_t)$$, as observation sequence doesn't satisfy first order Markovian property.

In the course, they use an example to show the difference between $$o_t$$ and $$s_t$$:
<div align='center'><img src="../assets/images/285-2-os.png" alt="o and s" width="500"></div>
But throughout the course (also in coding homework), they actually treat observation directly as state :)


In this course, we will mainly consider MDPs. We even use the observations (i.e. sensory measurements like images) during learning as the state in MDPs.

## 2 The Goal of Reinforcement Learning
Before presenting the goal of reinforcement learning, we have one more very important concept to introduce --- **trajectory** $$\tau:=(s_1, a_1, s_2, a_2, \cdots, s_T, a_T)$$. In MDPs, we can write out the distribution of $$\tau$$:

$$\begin{equation}\label{traj_dist}p_{\theta}(\tau) = p_{\theta}(s_1, a_1, \cdots, s_T, a_T)= p(s_1)\prod_{i=1}^{T}\pi_{\theta}(a_t\mid s_t)p(s_{t+1}\mid s_t, a_t)\end{equation}$$

This distribution can also be writen as $$p_{\theta}(\tau) = \prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\theta}(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}\mid s_t, a_t)$$, where $$p_{\theta}(s_{t+1},a_{t+1}\mid s_t, a_t) = p(s_{t+1}\mid s_t, a_t)\pi_{\theta}(a_{t+1}\mid s_{t+1})$$

The goal of reinforcement learning is to find the best policy to **maximize the expected reward**, i.e. 

$$\begin{align}
\theta^*
&= \text{argmax}_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim p_{\theta}(\tau)}\sum_{t=1}^T r(s_t, a_t) \label{eq:goal1}\\
&= \text{argmax}_{\theta} \sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}_{(s_t,a_t) \sim p_{\theta}(s_t, a_t)}r(s_t, a_t) \label{eq:goal2}
\end{align}$$

What if $$T = \inf$$? In this case the above optimization is over an expectation of infinite summation or infinite summation of an expectation! However, if $$ p_{\theta}(s_t, a_t)$$ converge to an stationary distribution $$p_{\theta}(s,a)$$, we can optimize the following as our goal:

$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:goal3} \theta^* = \text{argmax}_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{(s,a) \sim p_{\theta}(s, a)}r(s, a)\end{equation}$$

This is because when $$T = \inf$$, $$r(s,a)$$ where $$s$$ and $$a$$ are from the stationary distribution $$p_{\theta}(s,a)$$ will dominate the summation in equation $$\ref{eq:goal2}$$ (because there are infinite many of them!). And therefore, equation $$\ref{eq:goal3}$$ is asymtotically equivalent to equation $$\ref{eq:goal2}$$.


## 3 The Framework of RL Algorithm
Most of the RL algorithm can be framed as the following plot:
<div align="center"><img src="../assets/images/285-3-frame.png" alt="framework" width="700"></div>
This is a loop, but let's start with the orange box --- generate samples, just as supervised learning and unsupervised learning, data is the fuel for reinforcement learning. The samples are **trajectories** i.e. $$\{\tau_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$$ where $$\tau_i = (s^i_1, a^i_1, \cdots, s^i_T, a^i_T)$$ is one trajectory, and **rewards** i.e. $$\{ r^i \}_{i=1}^{N}$$, where $$r^i_t = (r^i_1, \cdots, r^i_T)$$ ($$T$$ doesn't have to be the same for every trajectory). The trajectories are typically obtained from the trajectory distribution $$p_{\theta}(\tau)$$ which is induced by policy $$\pi_{\theta}(a_t\mid o_t)$$ (shown in equation $$\ref{traj_dist}$$), which means trajectores are obtained by runnig the policy. Note that there are other ways to get trajectories such as using exploration methods. Rewards are obtained from the environment (real environment or simulator), which is usually specified by human in advance. Note that we can also learn a reward function using e.g. inverse reinforcement learning.

With trajecteries, we go to the green box, where we will either try to explicitly fit the model $$p(s_{t+1}\mid s_t, a_t)$$, or estimate the expected return, which is actually evaluating the current policy. Lastly we go to the blue box to change the policy to make it better. And then repeat the process. In some algorithms, some parts might be very complex and some might be very simple.

One simple example is basic *policy gradient* algorithm, which is shown below
<div align="center"><img src="../assets/images/285-3-policy.png" alt="policy gradient" width="700"></div>

Another more complex example, which attempts to fit the model, let's call it *model-based policy learning*.
<div align="center"><img src="../assets/images/285-3-with-model.png" alt="policy gradient" width="700"></div>
<!-- $$\begin{align*}
J(\theta) 
&= \mathbb{E}_{p_{\theta}(\tau)}\sum_t r(s_t, a_t) \\
&\approx \frac1N \sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{t = 1}r^i_t
\end{align*}$$

<!--$$\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha\nabla_{\theta}J(\theta)$$
 -->

To explain, there are two learnable components in the algorithm --- the transition model $$f_{\phi}(s_t, a_t)$$, and policy $$\pi_{\theta}$$. The objective is 

$$\begin{equation}
J(\phi,\theta) = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_t \left\|f_{\phi}(s_t, a_t) - s_{t+1}\right\|^2
\end{equation}$$

You might wonder why is the objective a function of $$\theta$$? This is because action $$a_t\sim \pi_{\theta}(a_t\mid f_{\phi}(s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}))$$. However, differentiating $$J(\phi, \theta)$$ w.r.t. $$\theta$$ is not straightforward, as sampling is involved in the computation. Luckily, people have developed varies tricks such as the reparameterization trick to handle differentiation through sampling. In fact, here we assume the transition model $$f_{\phi}(s_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$$ is deterministic, but it can also be a distribution $$p_{\theta}(s_t\mid s_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$$, in which case obtaining the gradient w.r.t $$\phi$$ also involves differentiation through sampling. 

<!-- learn $$f_{\phi}(s_t, a_t) \; s.t. \; s_{t+1} \approx f_{\phi}(s_t, a_t)$$ 

take
$$a_{t+1} \leftarrow \pi_{\theta}(a_{t+1}\mid f_{\phi}(s_t, a_t))$$  -->

<!-- $$J(\phi,\theta) = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_t \left\|f_{\phi}(s_t, a_t) - s_{t+1}\right\|^2$$

$$\theta \leftarrow \theta - \alpha\nabla_{\theta}J(\phi, \theta)$$ -->

Don't worry if any of the above is not clear to you, we will cover these algorithms in later lectures.

Before moving on to the next section, let's talk about the three boxes in turns of which is expensive and which is cheap. First of all, as I said before, the complexity of three boxes in different algorithms are different, but it is always true that the orange box is expensive if the algorithm is running in real world, i.e. the robot is operating and collecting data in the real world. But we also have all sorts of simulator which can (drastically) speed up the process. However, there is an inevitable gap between the simulator and the really world (Can we build a simulator that is exactly the same as the real world? That's impossible for now, because this means we have a perfect model of how the world operates)

How about the green box? For policy gradient, it's just a summation over rewards, which is very fast, but for model-based policy learning, we need to do gradient update to learn the model, which is more expensive than just summation. For the blue box, policy gradient will do gradient update, while even though model-based policy leraning is also doing gradient update here, it's more expensive, because the gradient is calculated by backpropagation through time (the first decision affect all later states, the second decision affect all but first state etc. The process is recursive).
